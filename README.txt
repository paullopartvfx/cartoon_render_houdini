Hey!
This app will allow you to have quick "toon looking" renders. It will create a cop network and with the UI you will be able to modify the important values. Also will have presets for toon looking materials so you can have great results quickly. Also presets for volumes and other kind of FX. A camera that allows you to render framerate variance will also be part of the app.

More updates coming soon.

Thanks for your time!
