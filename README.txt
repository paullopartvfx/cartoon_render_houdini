Hey! This app will simplify the task of always looking at the last approved cache. Normally this would be handled by the pipeline but in many smaller companies there is not this kind of automization. The idea is that you will be able to open a scene and import all the latest assets, caches, anims and it will warn you later on if something is not the most recent approved. You will see description, date and comments of all the tasks

Thanks for your time!
